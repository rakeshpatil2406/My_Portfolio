        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><b>In the Year 2021:  <br></b>
  
          In the transformative year of 2021, I found myself in the dynamic phase of youth, navigating through a myriad of challenges and seizing the opportunities that unfolded before me. Academically, I achieved noteworthy success by completing my 10th and 12th standards with distinction, securing an impressive 83% in both classes. <br>
          
          One of the significant milestones of this year was the realization of a dream â€“ the construction of my own house, made possible through the support of the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana. Additionally, the joyous occasion of my sister's wedding on May 24, 2021, added a memorable chapter to the familial tapestry. <br>
          
          Choosing the biology stream (PCMB) for my higher secondary education, I initially harbored aspirations of joining the defense forces, inspired by my maternal uncle. However, circumstances led me to shift gears, and I ultimately pursued a B.Tech. degree in Bhopal. In 2021, I became an active member of the National Service Scheme (NSS), setting the stage for my involvement in the Air Wing of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at Motilal Nehru Mahavidyalaya in Bhopal the following year, in 2022. Achieving a B certificate in NSS in 2023 marked a significant milestone in my journey of service and self-discovery. <br>
          
          During my time in Bhopal, I had the exhilarating experience of flying the Virus SW 80 aircraft with short wings, under the command of Group Captain Ramesh S Jadhav. I participated actively in two NSS camps in 2021 and 2022 and a NCC camp named CATC (Combined Annual Training Camp) at BIRTS. My dedication to service even led me to aspire for the Republic Day Camp (RDC) for both NSS and NCC. <br>
          
          <b>   In the Year 2022: <br></b>
       
          
          Continuing my journey in 2022, I engaged in various events and activities that further enriched my experiences. I showcased my skills in the LPG parade on Republic Day, January 26, 2023, and actively participated in the Pankh Marathon on February 26, 2023, and the Gaurav Run on June 1, 2023. My commitment to physical fitness was evident as I secured the 2nd rank in the 200-meter race at Trinity Campus. <br>
          
          On the academic front, I delved into the world of Object-Oriented Programming in C++, undergoing a comprehensive 7-day training. The year also witnessed a significant shift in my living arrangements, transitioning from Mahakal City and Anand Nagar to securing a hostel in Katara Hills during my second year of college. <br>
          
       <b>   In the Year 2023: <br></b>
          
          The year 2023 marked a phase of significant personal and academic growth. Recognizing the importance of technology in education, I invested in my academic journey by purchasing a laptop, an Honor MagicBook 14, priced at 39000, from Flipkart in February. <br>
          
          Eager to broaden my horizons, I actively pursued various government examinations, including Delhi Police, SSC GD, SSC CHSL, SSC MTS, AGNIVAYU in Jabalpur, AGNIVEER in Lal Parade Ground, DBMS, ETHICAL HACKING, C++ COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING, MP POLICE, MP POLICE TECHNICAL, SSC SELECTION POST XI, COAST GUARD in Vaishnavi College, and COAST GUARD in Mittal Group of Institutes Bhopal near People Mall. Medical examinations were also undertaken at AIIMS Bhopal and AIIMS Nagpur. <br>
          
          Not limiting myself to examinations, I sought to expand my skill set. I delved into the world of programming, learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java, C++, and the basics of Python. These coding languages not only became tools for problem-solving but also opened up new avenues in the world of technology and programming. <br>
          
          As the years progressed, my journey became a harmonious blend of academic achievements, active participation in various camps and events, and a persistent thirst for knowledge and personal development. Each experience contributed to shaping the person I am today, and I eagerly anticipate embracing the future with enthusiasm and determination. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
